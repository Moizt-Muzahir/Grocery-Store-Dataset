# Grocery Store Dataset
🏪 This is a dataset built to be used for object detection of grocery store items, focused primarily on products available in Pakistani Grocery Stores. 

📁 Each category has a separate folder and each product of each category further has separate folders where images and .xml files of labels are stored. 

LabelImg has been used to label the dataset.
Currently only 2 categories are in this dataset with one product of each category. Feel free to contribute and add comments.
