# Grocery Store Dataset
🏪 This is a dataset built to be used for object detection of grocery store items, focused primarily on products available in Pakistani Grocery Stores. 

📁 Each category has a separate folder and each product of each category further has separate folders where images and .xml files of labels are stored. 

**Note:**
- LabelImg has been used to label the dataset.
- Currently only 2 categories are in this dataset with one product of each category. Feel free to contribute and add comments.
